## Project 2

For this project, I designed a differential drive robot and populated it in my Gazebo world. Ultimately, the robot follows the white ball but when not seen on site (via camera placed in front of the robot), it'll halt. I created two ROS packages. One package that contains all the information about the robot, and the other package that holds two nodes to control the robot (Two nodes explained below) 

This client node will subscribe to the robotâ€™s camera images and analyze them to determine the position of the white ball. Once the ball position is determined, the client node will request a service from the drive_bot server node to drive the robot toward the ball. The robot can drive either left, right or forward, depending on the robot position inside the image.
