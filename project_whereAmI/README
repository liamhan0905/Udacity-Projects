For this project, I designed a differential drive robot and populated it in my Gazebo world. Ultimately, the robot follows the white ball but when it can't detect the white ball (via camera placed in front of the robot), it'll halt. I created two ROS packages. One package that contains all the information about the robot, and the other package that holds two nodes to control the robot (Two nodes explained below)
